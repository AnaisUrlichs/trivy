## Contribute Rego Checks

The contributing section provides detailed information on

* how to contribute custom checks to the [trivy-policies repository](../../../../community/contribute/checks/overview.md/)
* add [new services](../../../../community/contribute/checks/service-support.md) to existing cloud providers
* add a [new provider](../../../../community/contribute/checks/provider-support.md/)

This way, they become accessible as default [policies.](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-policies)
